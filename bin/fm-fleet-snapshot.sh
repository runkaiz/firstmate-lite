# fm-fleet-snapshot.sh - structured fleet snapshot with observational caching.
#
# Output contract: `--json` prints one object with schema
# `fm-fleet-snapshot.v1`.
# The command does not acquire the session lock, drain wakes, arm watchers,
# mutate backlog state, or write reports. Its default ledger collector may
# atomically refresh parent-side cached copies of remote home summaries under
# state/secondmate-summary-cache; those observational cache writes are its only
# fleet-state mutation.
#
# Top-level fields:
#   schema: stable schema id.
#   generated: UTC observation time for this fresh command execution.
#   fm_home: resolved operational home.
#   roots: resolved root/config/data/state/projects directories.
#   backlog: {path,present,records[]} where records are ordered as written in
#     data/backlog.md and cover In flight, Queued, and Done.
#     Canonical tasks-axi rows are structured; free-form non-empty lines in
#     those sections are preserved as unstructured records.
#     Structured rows preserve captain-hold metadata such as hold_kind,
#     hold_reason, and hold_until when tasks-axi emits it. They also carry
#     normalized current_role, requires_child_metadata, blocked_by_ids,
#     unresolved_blocker_ids, captain_actionable, hold_set, hold_age_days,
#     and hold_bucket fields.
#     Repeated blocker tokens remain ordered; a blocker resolves only when its
#     structured record is Done, and missing ids stay open.
#     There is no separate decision type: any captain-held task is the same
#     primitive, whatever kind its row carries.
#     hold_bucket is the single classification for every captain hold, decided
#     only from structured fields - state, hold_kind, hold_until,
#     unresolved_blocker_ids, and the machine-written hold-set timestamp. No
#     hold reason or body prose is ever matched. The buckets are total and
#     mutually exclusive, so every captain hold lands in exactly one and none
#     can fall through: "blocked" when any blocker is unresolved, else "dated"
#     when hold_until is still in the future, else "aged" when an undated hold
#     is at least FM_SNAPSHOT_UNDATED_HOLD_AGE_DAYS old (default 14; legacy
#     unstamped holds fall back to `since`), else "live". A non-captain or Done
#     row carries null.
#     captain_actionable means "waiting on the captain now" and is exactly
#     hold_bucket == "live".
#     hold_age_days is the hold's age when computable, else null.
#     Aging is a projection safety net only: the durable deferral remains
#     re-holding with --until.
#     Renderers keep every non-live bucket out of the default Captain's Call,
#     project it as a Charted Next gate stating why, and disclose it in
#     omitted[]; --all-decisions reveals every captain hold available within the
#     bounded snapshot.
#   tasks[]: one row per task metadata record captured at snapshot start, sorted
#     by id. A record removed before capture is omitted. If a captured task's
#     generation changes while observations run, its selected metadata remains
#     but mutable current-state, status, report, and endpoint evidence is discarded
#     rather than attributed to the replacement generation.
#     Local current_state is parsed from bin/fm-crew-state.sh <id> and preserves
#     state, source, detail, and raw line separately. Remote secondmate rows use
#     an explicit unknown value because their endpoint liveness belongs to
#     supervision rather than this snapshot path.
#     paths.status_log.last_event is historical wake-event data only, never
#     current state. age_seconds is null when the emission time is unknown;
#     fm-classify-lib.sh owns the optional emission-time field, and only the
#     age derived from it is published here. A future event time leaves that age
#     unknown rather than clamped to zero.
#     hints.open_decisions is the keyed open-decision set returned by
#     fm-classify-lib.sh's authoritative status_open_decisions fold and reconciled
#     against current_state; hints.pending_decision and hints.blocked_event are
#     booleans derived from that set.
#     endpoint.exists is the cheap local backend endpoint-presence read.
#     endpoint.agent_alive is populated for local secondmates only, where it is
#     useful return-channel supervision data; remote secondmates use "unknown"
#     without a probe, and other tasks use "not_checked".
#   scout_reports[]: present data/<id>/report.md pointers.
#   main_inventory: {valid,reason,orphan_in_flight[],unstructured_current_count} -
#     main-home current-inventory checks shared with secondmate_home_summary_json
#     (orphan structured in-flight ids with no state/<id>.meta, and unstructured
#     current backlog rows). Does not invent live tasks; meta remains truth for
#     workers. Bearings maps failures into omitted[] disclosure (and a Charted
#     Next gate line) rather than silent empty Underway.
#   secondmate_current: {records[],total,shown,truncated} - bounded current summaries
#     for registered secondmates, selected from validated structured state inside
#     each home with explicit provenance, freshness, endpoint evidence, and unknown
#     failure reasons. Parent status and bounded terminal evidence are historical,
#     untrusted supplements only and never override readable structured-home facts.
#     parent_event carries age_seconds from the task's paths.status_log.last_event
#     above. An unreadable-home fallback reports freshness.age_seconds from the
#     observed status file's mtime instead: freshness is how fresh this snapshot's
#     own observation is, never when a worker emitted the event.
#     Each structured-home record carries active_children, decisions_open, holds,
#     queued, landed, endpoints, counts, and omitted. provenance.summary_source
#     distinguishes "local-ledger", "remote-ledger", and "remote-ledger-cache";
#     freshness is "cached" only for the cache source, and observed_at/age_seconds
#     come from the selected summary's generation. Every successfully sampled home also carries
#     reconcile_inventory independently of projection trust.
#     Actionable captain holds appear in decisions_open; every captain hold remains
#     in the bounded queued inventory with its structured classification metadata.
#     Before that queued bound is applied, non-captain-actionable rows are selected
#     ahead of captain-actionable rows so separately projected live decisions cannot
#     crowd Charted-Next-eligible work out of the summary. Each group is ordered by
#     filed date newest first, with undated rows stable at the end.
#     Structured-home input must declare the current home-summary and hold-classifier
#     schemas; a live ledger or cached copy missing either declaration or declaring
#     an unsupported version is unavailable even when it contains no captain holds.
#     These schemas also accept v1 summaries from older producers.
#   secondmate_landed: {records[],truncated[],unreadable[],partial[]} - the
#     compatibility landed-work roll-up derived from secondmate_current. Readable
#     structured homes are partial, not unreadable, when an unavailable child state
#     or a backlog-vs-metadata inventory mismatch makes their summary incomplete;
#     they retain independently trustworthy structured surfaces. An inventory
#     mismatch also keeps the home's own current classification, which only an
#     unavailable child state or an untrustworthy backlog collapses to unknown.
#     Which closed rows a home contributes is bin/fm-landed-lib.sh's rule, shared
#     with the bearings projection so one Recently Landed section has one owner.
#   contributions: cached owned-contribution coverage; fm-contributions.sh owns it.
#   secondmate_guidance: return-channel action note for renderers and bearings.
#
# --contribution-input prints only the canonical backlog/tasks ownership pair,
# without worker observations or cross-home collection, for the home-local poll.
# Compatibility: JSON is the primary machine-readable surface.
# Human views must render this output instead of parsing state files again.

usage: fm-fleet-snapshot.sh --json
       fm-fleet-snapshot.sh --secondmate-home-summary

Print a structured snapshot of the firstmate fleet.
JSON is the stable machine-readable output contract. The default snapshot
refreshes only its parent-side remote-summary cache as an observational side effect.

--contribution-input emits the canonical local backlog/tasks ownership pair only,
without worker observations or cross-home collection.

--secondmate-home-summary emits the bounded structured summary used after a
validated registered-home handoff. It is local-only, skips nested secondmate
aggregation, includes generated_epoch for freshness arithmetic, and marks
inventory contradictions or unavailable child state invalid.
kind=secondmate meta records are not child inventory for unowned_current or
terminal_in_flight; they never have backlog rows.
Its invalidity object names the normalized failure kind and affected ids.
Actionable tasks-axi captain holds appear as decisions_open and stay visible in
queued with hold_reason, hold_kind, hold_until,
hold_bucket, hold_age_days, and plural blocker fields for downstream
projections. A captain hold is actionable only when every blocker is Done, any
hold-until date has arrived, and an undated hold remains below the aging threshold.
Cross-home collection uses FM_SNAPSHOT_SECONDMATES (default 20, 0 lifts the
count bound) and FM_SNAPSHOT_SECONDMATE_MAX_BYTES.
Every sampled remote home's state/home-summary.json is fetched concurrently
under one FM_SNAPSHOT_BUDGET (default 5 seconds), with a valid prior copy under
FM_SNAPSHOT_CACHE_DIR used when the live read fails, is invalid, or consumes the
budget. Every ledger and cached copy must declare the current hold-classifier
schema, even when it contains no captain holds; older summaries are rejected. A
home with neither a valid current ledger nor a valid current cached copy is
reported unreadable with the reason; collection never computes a summary in
that home.
Each local per-task current-state read is bounded by FM_SNAPSHOT_CREW_STATE_TIMEOUT
(default 10 seconds); a read that hits the bound reports state unknown. Local task
observations run concurrently, up to FM_SNAPSHOT_LOCAL_READ_CONCURRENCY (default 8).
Remote secondmate endpoint liveness is not probed by this command.
Terminal contradiction evidence uses
FM_SNAPSHOT_TERMINAL_LINES, FM_SNAPSHOT_TERMINAL_BYTES, and
FM_SNAPSHOT_TERMINAL_TIMEOUT and never becomes canonical current state.
Parent activity evidence uses FM_SNAPSHOT_PARENT_ACTIVITY_LINES,
FM_SNAPSHOT_PARENT_ACTIVITY_BYTES, FM_SNAPSHOT_PARENT_ACTIVITIES, and
FM_SNAPSHOT_PARENT_ACTIVITY_TIMEOUT, with truncation disclosed in the result.
The registered secondmate table uses FM_SNAPSHOT_REGISTRY_LINES,
FM_SNAPSHOT_REGISTRY_BYTES, FM_SNAPSHOT_REGISTRY_RECORDS, and
FM_SNAPSHOT_REGISTRY_TIMEOUT, with unavailability and truncation disclosed.
Every captain hold carries hold_bucket, decided only from structured fields and
never from hold reason or body prose: "blocked", "dated", "aged", or "live".
An undated hold ages once its hold-set timestamp is at least
FM_SNAPSHOT_UNDATED_HOLD_AGE_DAYS old (default 14; 0 ages every hold with a
non-negative computed age); legacy holds without a stamp fall back to their
since date, and re-holding with --until remains the durable deferral.
